# Secure-digital-wallet
Secure Digital Wallet project demonstrating ECC-based cryptography for blockchain security. It generates secp256k1 key pairs, encrypts private keys using AES-256, signs transactions with ECDSA, and verifies integrity using SHA-256 hashing, ensuring secure key management and tamper-proof digital transactions.
